# Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## **Description**
This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict lung cancer based on clinical and behavioral features. Using advanced algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the goal is to create an accurate and reliable system for early detection of lung cancer. By identifying individuals at higher risk, the project aims to enable timely medical intervention and improve treatment outcomes.

The dataset includes key features such as:
- **Demographics**: Gender and age
- **Behavioral Factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, peer pressure
- **Clinical Symptoms**: Chronic diseases, fatigue, wheezing, coughing, chest pain

The project also addresses challenges like class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** and selects key features with **RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)** to enhance the performance of the models.
